Inception
A project hated by many, loved by few

Dear fellow 42 student,
In this repo you will find my complete project that I submitted, and successfully passed.
As tempting as it may be, I strongly discourage you to blindly copy it and pass it as your own, as it sometimes happens.
I do understand that, for many people, the subject of system administration, virtualisation, containers and micro-services may be very abstract, difficult and overall it may seem like a waste of time.
I do believe that to be a decent programmer, you do not only need to be able to write good code, but you should also have a deep understanding of the tools you use to write it.
If you can write programs in C and C++, you should be just as able to implement a simple infrastructure of micro-services using Docker containers and shell scripts.

I personally loved this project. As much as I like writing actual code, I enjoyed the idea of implementing my very own infrastructure.
Granted, it did not do much more than power up a simple Wordpress page using a few services, but I saw that as a good opportunity to 'express' myself in a way.
Consider Minishell for example: the project you did was your own. In the end, there are no two projects alike, because every single one is the result of someone's intepretation, effort, commitment, and reasoning.
I see my Inception about the same: it is the result of my own 'creativity' in a way, and it made me relive childhood memories of having my first computer.
In a way, it was a similar experience of trying to install and uninstall things, try to make them work, fail a lot, not understand why, look it up on the Internet, try again, and finally succeed after hours of hard fight with the machine.

Anyway, I do not blame you if you do not like this project.
Regardless of whether you like it or not, the lack of tutorials and other literature makes it a quite obscure project, and Docker is not exactly a very intuitive tool, especially in the beginning.
As often, it is easier to find a ready-made project that was passed by someone than an actual tutorial that will explain all the key points, and that is a shame.

Having said that, here are a couple of links that might help you start on your Inception journey:

And a couple of personal tips:
+ If you can, use your personal computer to do the project. The evaluation has to be done on your campus' computers, on a virtual machine with the distribution of your choice. Virtual machines are, in my experience, extremely slow and may crash under a big load. If you have a personal computer with a Linux distribution, you can save yourself from a lot of trouble and headaches if you write the project on it instead of the school's computers.
+ If you use your own computer, you will have to install Docker first, and then add your user to the Docker group to run the service. It took me about 5 minutes following the official Docker's instruction.
